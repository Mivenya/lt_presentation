# Main File to run project. Aggregate data from Kaggle ML and DS Surveys from 2017 - 2022 to analyze trends for lightning talk presentation purposes

# The purpose of the lightning talk is to show trends of growth in ML and DS.
# Based on finding possibly highlight not just number of people but gender/location etc?

#Begin with importing Libraries

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Next we will be pulling data from multiple datasets but want to narrow down what info we want.  
# I know showing number of responses, gender, locations, employed status could all be useful for showing trends
